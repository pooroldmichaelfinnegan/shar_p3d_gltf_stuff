to convert face normal (which the p3d defines) to vertex normals (to use in gltf model)

first gonna improve the p3djson parser, make more objectoriented idk
then triple the face normal vectors

the intersect triangle primitives use degerate verticies (using same vertex more than once per primitive)
i fail to remember why this is potentially problematic

wondering if dumping all vectors into .bin and then sorting out all primitives by terain type into seperate views

l1_int_types.bin buffer offsets
